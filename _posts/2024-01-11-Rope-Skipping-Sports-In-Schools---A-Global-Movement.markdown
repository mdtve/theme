## The Rapid Growth of Interschool Rope Skipping Competitions 

Over the past decade, rope skipping has grown tremendously in popularity among school children around the world. What started as isolated programs in a few countries has expanded into a major international youth sport. In 2015, the founding of the World Inter-School Rope Skipping Organisation (WIRSO) helped catalyze this growth by promoting competitive rope skipping at the interschool level on a global scale. Since hosting the first world championships in the United Arab Emirates, over 80 countries have begun incorporating rope skipping into their national physical education curriculums and organising competitions between schools.

### Growing Participation in Nigeria

In 2021, the Ondo State Rope Skipping Association in Nigeria started their inaugural annual interschool championship tournament. Over 200 schools from the state participated in the competition which helped identify talented young skippers while encouraging physical activity. Seeing the success, other Nigerian states soon followed with establishing their own interschool rope skipping leagues and events. The growing interest in Nigeria demonstrates how rope skipping programs can spread within a large country once started in just one region.

## Championship Events Around the World

WIRSO sanctions world championship tournaments that take place every two years where nations send teams of six skippers each to compete against one another. The main events include speed rope, freestyle, team relay, and complex routines performed to music. Photos from the past three world championships hosted in Hong Kong, Belgium, and Hungary showcase the amazing skills of the child athletes. Through social media and live streaming, viewers around the globe are able to witness the outstanding rope techniques demonstrated by participants as young as eight years old in front of large crowds. 

### Growing Popularity in Asia and Europe  

Even with the postponed 2020 championship due to the pandemic, interest continued growing. Countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines all worked to promote rope skipping as part of school curriculums. Meanwhile in Europe, nations such as England, Poland and Germany saw expanding club programs form. The cancellation provided time for these areas to further establish their interschool and community rope skipping initiatives.

## Coaching Programs and Health Benefits

Coaches involved with national federations and school programs structure practice sessions applying the FITT principle - frequency, intensity, time, and type of activity. Multiple short sessions per week focus on improving flexibility, coordination, agility and cardiovascular endurance through learning new techniques and skills. Practice is meant to not only develop strong rope skippers but also encourage fitness and maintaining a healthy lifestyle in children. Participating schools have seen positive impacts like increased self-confidence from mastering challenges.

## Future of Interschool Competitions

With so many nations actively engaged after over half a decade, WIRSO will need to consider standardizing international competition regulations. As the number of participants grows each tournament, separating future world championships into ability-based divisions may work better than one open category. Broadcasting competitions online through live streaming provides chances to reach larger audiences as well as identify talent deserving of support through scholarships or sponsorships to help advance their skills. These changes can maintain the rapid progression seen while also preserving the spirit of inclusive competition.

## Conclusion

Rope skipping has evolved remarkably fast from isolated local programs into one of the premier youth sports worldwide practiced in schools. Through the coordinated efforts of organizations like WIRSO working with nations and states, competitive interschool rope skipping continues to expand participation on every continent. With ongoing development of both athletes and community programs, the future remains bright for continued growth promoting healthy lifestyles in children on a global scale through this activity.
