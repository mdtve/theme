## Finding My Angel

### A Scared Puppy in the Garage

I was working in the garage one day when I heard a faint whimper coming from behind some boxes. When I investigated, I found a tiny puppy cowering in the corner, eyes wide with fear. It was skin and bones and clearly hadn't eaten in days. I gently coaxed it out and carried it inside, where I gave it some food and water. Over the next few weeks, I slowly gained its trust with treats and belly rubs. After putting up signs and asking around the neighborhood with no success in finding the owner, I decided this little guy had found its furever home with me.

## Naming and Training Her 

### Angel Helped Lift My Depression 

As the puppy helped lift my mood during a difficult time, I decided to name her Angel. She was a quick learner too. Within a day, Angel had mastered sitting on command and would fetch the newspaper from the front porch each morning. Her other new trick was walking across a ladder in the yard - she conquered that challenge in just one afternoon. My heart leapt into my throat one day when I came home to an empty house - only to find Angel a few blocks away, paper still clutched happily in her mouth. 

## Our Unbreakable Bond

### My Shadow and Protector

Angel stuck to my side like glue from that point on. Wherever I went in the house, she was there. And she insisted on sleeping right up against me in bed each night. My wife thought Angel and I were too co-dependent, but I loved having my furry companion by my side constantly. Angel also proved she was very intuitive - she always knew when I was feeling down or coming down with an illness, and would cuddle extra close for comfort. She was truly man's best friend.

## Moving and a Scary Moment  

### A Clifftop Snafu

When my job required a move to another state, Angel came along adventuring in the car. We stopped at a scenic overlook and I let her out to stretch her legs. Strong gusts of wind nearly blew me over the edge of the cliff when Angel's leash went taut, yanking me to safety. She had sensed the danger and anchored herself to save me. I was grateful for her keen instincts and guardian nature. 

## Angel Falls Ill

### A Sad Vet Visit   

I started noticing blood spots in Angel's water bowl and noticing she seemed tired and listless. At the vet, they found internal bleeding and diagnosed her with diabetes as well. With a prognosis of just two difficult years ahead of extensive medical care and suffering, the humane choice was to put her to sleep and end her pain. It was the hardest decision but the most loving thing to do for my dear companion.

## Coping with Loss

### Grief and a Failed Relationship 

I was inconsolable with grief for three full weeks after Angel passed. No one, not even my wife, understood the depth of the bond I'd shared with my canine companion. Soon other issues in our relationship surfaced and we parted ways not long after. It was a difficult time, but having Angel in my life for those few precious years made it all worthwhile.

## Remembering My Angel  

### The Joy She Brought Lives On

To this day, I still miss Angel dearly. Her memory and the joy she brought to my life sustain me. A picture of her sits proudly on my mantle - her bright eyes and lolling tongue reminding me of happier times. While the ache of loss never fully goes away, I find comfort in knowing that for however briefly, an angel did come into my world when I needed her most. Her imprint on my heart will last forever.
