### Where We are Now

Artificial intelligence and machine learning have begun finding applications in education with the goal of helping students learn more effectively and helping teachers manage their classes. AI tutoring systems are being developed that can assess a student's strengths and weaknesses, customize lesson plans, and provide individualized feedback and practice problems. Teachers can also utilize AI to automate grading of assignments like essays and calculate student progress. While still early, the potential of AI in education is exciting.

### Personalized Learning 

One of the most promising applications of AI is personalized learning where technology adapts in real-time to a student's abilities, focusing on their unique needs and allowing them to learn at their own pace. An AI tutor can observe a student's work, understand where they struggle, and recommend additional exercises, videos or explanations on those topics to help them improve. The system tracks each student's progress and continually refines its understanding of their skills to keep lessons engaging and adjusted to their current level. This level of customization at scale would be nearly impossible without AI.

### Adaptive Assessments

AI and machine learning are also enabling new forms of adaptive assessments. Computerized exams can automatically adjust difficulty based on whether a student got the previous question right or wrong, focusing more time on areas where they need improvement. Furthermore, AI makes it possible to understand concepts being tested from short form or open responses, expanding what can be evaluated from traditional multiple choice. As AI assessments become more sophisticated, they have the potential to provide real-time feedback teachers can use to target instruction throughout a course, not just at the end.

### Automated Marking  

One of the biggest time sinks for teachers is grading assignments like essays, problem sets and labs. AI is being developed to automate routine grading tasks like checking for plagiarism, formatting, computations and more basic elements. Natural language processing allows systems to read and comprehend short and long form written responses. While full automation of grading complex assignments is still a ways off, AI promises to make the process much more efficient by handling initial checks, flagging potential issues for human review, and standardizing scores across assignments. This frees up instructors to focus on higher-level feedback.

### New Models of Education

Perhaps the most exciting potential of AI is enabling new models for delivering education that were not previously possible. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) aimed at unlimited participation have struggled with low completion rates, but AI has the ability to scale personalized learning to millions. Blended models that combine in-person and online instruction mediated by an AI tutor could expand access to education in underserved areas. As the capabilities of AI continue progressing, we may see new paradigms for teaching and learning that take full advantage of technology's powers. The future of education with AI looks incredibly promising.
