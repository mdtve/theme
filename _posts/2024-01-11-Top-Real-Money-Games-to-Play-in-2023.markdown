### Daily Fantasy Sports on DraftKings and FanDuel
Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) exploded in popularity around 2015 and sites like DraftKings and FanDuel led the way. Whereas traditional fantasy leagues unfold over a full season, DFS contests focus on single games or weekends. Participants assemble virtual lineups of real athletes under a daily salary cap.

Some contests simply pay top finishes, while larger multi-entry tournaments award prize pools totaling millions. Making optimal lineup choices on a short week-to-week basis tests savvy analysis and gut feelings.

Major US sports dominate the DFS selection pools. Association Football (soccer), basketball, American football, baseball, hockey, motor sports and mixed martial arts constitute frequent single-day matchups. Entrants strive to predict which players will exceed expectations to pull away in scoring. While inherently relying on some luck, DFS rewards aggressive strategies and in-depth sports knowledge over the long haul. Top competitors earn five or even six figures annually through consistent study and lineup optimization. Entry fees start low to be accessible for casual contests, while high stakes matches run $1,000+ entry costs.
