## Introduction
Earth relies heavily on water in its oceans, atmosphere and ecosystems. Nearly three quarters of our planet is covered with water. This thought experiment imagines what would happen if we replaced all of Earth's water with its heavier isotope, heavy water. 

### Dependence on H2O
Water plays a crucial role in regulating Earth's climate and weather patterns. It is essential for life as we know it. Without normal water (H2O), the physical properties of our planet and the viability of life would change dramatically.

## Physical and Chemical Properties of Heavy Water
Heavy water (D2O) behaves differently than normal water due to its higher density, freezing point and boiling point. It has about 11% greater density than H2O, freezing at 3.82°C instead of 0°C and boiling at 101.4°C rather than 100°C. Heavy water's viscosity is also higher. 

### Altered Phase Changes  
The higher temperatures required for phase changes between liquid, solid and gas would disrupt physical processes on Earth. Heavy water's greater energy of vaporization and fusion means more heat is needed for evaporation and melting/freezing.

## Impacts on Ocean Environments
Instantly, oceans would become much denser as the primary constituent changed to heavy water. Most marine life could no longer easily swim due to this increased density. Creatures would need to adapt quickly or face extinction. 

### Freezing Shockwaves
With heavy water's freezing point over 3°C higher, much of the oceans would freeze solid in an instant. The shockwaves and bursting of heat from this rapid freezing could Level destructive tsunamis and damage coastlines worldwide. Shallow waters may provide refuges for some sea life.

## Weather and Climate Disruptions  
Global weather patterns would change dramatically with the switch to heavy water. Evaporation levels from oceans and plants would plummet due to heavy water's elevated heat of vaporization. 

### Worldwide Drought
Precipitation levels across the planet would drop sharply as moisture failed to rise into the atmosphere. Massive droughts could parch the land and endanger water supplies and agriculture untilrains adapted to the new conditions. Climate feedback loops might spiral out of control.

## Geographical and Geological Changes
With 10% greater density, heavy water ice sheets would exert different buoyant forces. Structural changes to glaciers and ice sheets could unleash tidal waves. 

### Coastline Alterations  
Coastlines may be reshaped as buildings, bridges and other constructs deal with altered fluid dynamics in the denser oceans. Earth's fractionally higher mass due to heavy water could also nudge global gravity slightly upward.  

## Impacts on Infrastructure and Technology 
Gravity tweaks from Earth's heavy water switch could destabilize satellites and space station orbits. GPS navigation would be thrown off by modified map grids and geographies. 

### Electrical Vulnerabilities
Changes to planetary magnetism may endanger power grids and electronics. Backup systems would need upgrading to withstand potential electromagnetic fluctuations. Communication networks require hardening against potential interruptions.

## Effects on Ecosystems and Human Civilization
With droughts decimating water supplies and climatic chaos jeopardizing agriculture, worldwide famines could take a devastating human toll. 

### Microbial Shifts   
Marine ecosystem pH imbalances caused by the chemical switch to heavy water threaten massive die-offs of ocean life. Changing bacterial conditions may endanger human health in the short and long term.

## Changes to Celestial Mechanics  
Earth's orientation and rotational momentum would slowly change as interactions with the sun and moon are adjusted by our planet's modified mass and gravity. 

### Shifting Orbital Resonances
Over thousands of years, these subtle gravitational tweaks could pull the moon into a closer orbital relationship with Earth. Alter planetary wobble and precession of its spin axis with unknown climatic impacts.

## Summary and Conclusions
Replacing H2O with its heavier isotope D2O shows how reliant Earth's habitability is on the unique physical properties of normal water. Cascading effects would transform our planet beyond facile recognition, challenging life at every scale. While certain localized refuges may emerge initially, widescale societal adaption seems unlikely before global catastrophe ensues. The lesson is our fortune to evolve where and as we have - and our responsibility to cherish rather than endanger the very rivers, rains and seas that have nurtured civilization itself.
