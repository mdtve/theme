## Elden Ring Dominated at Game Awards 2022 

Elden Ring had a phenomenal 2022, gaining widespread critical acclaim and commercial success upon release. At the 2022 Game Awards ceremony in December, Elden Ring took home the biggest honor of the night by winning Game of the Year. FromSoftware delivered an utterly engrossing open world that rewarded exploration at every turn. Players spent countless hours unraveling the game's rich lore by piecing together items and environmental storytelling. Its challenging yet fair combat presented a rewarding risk vs. reward system. Elden Ring rightfully earned its place among the all-time greats and will be remembered as one of the best games of the generation.

### God of War Ragnarok and Stray Also Shined

God of War Ragnarok followed up the beloved 2018 soft reboot with another stunning Norse adventure. Players loved continuing Kratos and Atreus' story with its deep combat, emotional narrative beats, and incredible presentation values. Ragnarok delivered top-tier action gameplay and production quality on par with blockbuster films. Meanwhile, the charming indie adventure Stray stood out with its heartwarming tale of a cat exploring a mysterious cybercity. Its minimalist storytelling and unique feline perspective earned it a devoted fanbase. Both games showed how great games can come from any scale of development.

## Zelda and Final Fantasy XVI Look to Shine in 2024 

Looking ahead to potential 2024 Game of the Year contenders, all eyes are on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Final Fantasy XVI. As Nintendo and Square Enix's latest sequels to beloved franchises, both carry sky-high expectations. Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom seeks to build upon the acclaimed open world of Breath of the Wild with new story arcs and expanded aerial exploration possibilities through Link's new climber ability. Final Fantasy XVI aims to return the mainline series to its story-driven single player roots after the MMO-inspired XV. Its medieval political intrigue and return to turn-based combat have fans eagerly anticipating its summer 2023 release. They have all the makings of genre-defining entries that could reign supreme in awards season. 

### Starfield and Surprise Hits May Also Contend

Meanwhile, Bethesda's highly anticipated sci-fi RPG Starfield launches in 2023 and could make a compelling case pending reviews. Its scope promises a massively ambitious setting to get lost in. There's also potential for surprise contenders from indie developers or unannounced projects from major studios. Games like Hades and It Takes Two have shown smaller titles can compete with triple-A games given the right combination of critical acclaim, gameplay innovation, and cultural impact. 2024 appears wide open for any number of GOTY contenders depending on which games most deeply resonate with critics and fans alike over the coming year.

## Resident Evil Village and Forza Horizon 5 Excelled in 2021

Looking back to favorites from 2021, Resident Evil Village built upon its acclaimed predecessor with an expanded world full of terror. Its gothic setting, unsettling foes like Lady Dimitrescu, and refined first-person action firmly established the series’ renewed direction. Meanwhile, racing fans couldn’t get enough of Forza Horizon 5. Its beautifully detailed open world recreating Mexico offered endless ways to cruise or compete. Players enjoyed collecting cars, taking on stunts and events, and simply soaking in the atmosphere wherever the road led. Both games expertly tapped into what makes their genres so compelling through inspired level design and slick, refined gameplay.

### Halo Infinite Brought the Series Back

The multiplayer component of Halo Infinite also stood out for revitalizing one of gaming's most iconic franchises. Its free-to-play arena shooter model brought in legions of new and returning players. Halo Infinite flawlessly blended classic arena combat with a rich progression system and customization options. While its campaign faced pacing issues, Infinite showed Master Chief still has what it takes to lead multiplayer shooters in fun factor and popularity. Its gameplay remained as tight and satisfying as ever, delivering countless memorable showdowns on diverse maps. Overall Halo Infinite gave the series a much-needed jolt that bodes well for its long term future.

## High Anticipation for Upcoming Games in 2023   

2023 has no shortage of anticipated sequels, new installments in beloved franchises, and promising new IPs on the horizon. Chief among them is The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, set to launch for Nintendo Switch in May. Building upon Breath of the Wild's phenomenal open world template, Tears of the Kingdom has fans eager to embark on Link's latest adventure across Hyrule and beyond. Another massive RPG due next summer is Final Fantasy XVI from Square Enix. It aims to bring the franchise back to gritty single player storytelling after the MMO-style Final Fantasy XV.

### New Armored Core Could Surprise Fans

FromSoftware itself may steal some of Elden Ring's thunder with a potential revival of its cult classic mech action series Armored Core. Little is known about From's plans for the beloved sci-fi franchise, but even the possibility of a new Armored Core has the gaming community buzzing. Meanwhile, Fireaxis' remaster of fan favorite survival game Remnant: From the Ashes in Remnant 2 could scratch that itch for hardcore co-op combat. Overall 2023 shows no shortage of potential game of the year nominees whether sequels, new franchises, or pleasant surprises emerge as standouts over the year.

## The Last of Us Part II Divided Fans 

Naughty Dog's 2020 release The Last of Us Part II remains one of the most discussed games of the last generation for how deeply it divided fan opinions. The developers took bold risks with the story that had unintended consequences. While gameplay saw polish, it didn't meaningfully evolve the third person survival formula. Fans felt mixed about brutal moments, character decisions that went against expectations, and whether the grim narrative still captured what made the original so special. To this day, debate continues over if The Last of Us Part II succeeded at what it set out to do, for better or worse. It showed how sequels can break new ground but also lose part of their original spirit.

### Pokémon Sword and Shield Disappointed Some Fans

2019's Pokémon Sword and Shield arrived on Nintendo Switch to a lukewarm reception from longtime fans. While the games made the series more accessible with quality of life improvements, they cut many features series veterans had come to expect. The limited regional Pokédex particularly irked completionists used to capturing 'em all. Additionally, an overabundance of easy encounters and streamlined challenges disappointed fans seeking a challenge. Sword and Shield delivered fun, casual Pokémon gameplay but lacked much substance for dedicated fans of the franchise who'd followed it for decades prior on portable and home consoles. It highlighted that even beloved series must evolve meaningfully with each new entry.

## Licensed Games Offered Familiar Formulas 

2022 saw the releases of multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) Pokémon Unite as well as single player action games like Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed and Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales based on popular franchises. However, these licensed titles relied more on established intellectual properties over truly innovative gameplay. Pokémon Unite transported the franchise into a familiar MOBA structure with few unique mechanics. Meanwhile, Ghostbusters and Stranger Things games felt like well-worn third person shooter and match-3 puzzle game tropes with a fresh coat of nostalgic paint but no substantial reinventions. Unless diehard fans of the parent properties, these games offered little to players seeking truly new experiences. Licensed games can succeed by infusing beloved worlds into creative genres instead of rehashes.

## Classics Like Ghost Recon, RE7 Still Impress  

Looking further back to 2017 favorites shows how timelessness remains the true test of great games. Titles like Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands, Resident Evil 7, and Assassin's Creed Origins have aged remarkably well. Wildlands launched the successful Ghost Recon sub-franchise of sprawling open world co-op. RE7 terrified in VR and reinvented survival horror for a new generation. Origins took the franchise to new historical heights with its rich recreation of ancient Egypt. Meanwhile, Middle-earth: Shadow of War and Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus excited with their story-driven single player shooting. Sports games and racing IPs like FIFA, Forza Motorsport 7 also found annual iterations retaining dedicated audiences. Even half a decade later, these classics remain outstanding representatives of their genres.

# Upcoming Years Offer Major Sequels and Surprises

With technology progressing gaming to new heights each generation and indies pushing boundaries, the future is bright for diverse new experiences. Major anticipated sequels like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Final Fantasy XVI will undoubtedly deliver. Meanwhile, surprises may emerge from any genre or developer if they deeply resonate. While awards highlight the year's most critically acclaimed, no game defines any industry or fandom alone - it's the sum of experiences that cultivate lifelong passions. With creativity constantly blooming, the upcoming years will undoubtedly continue delivering surprises and defining entries for different gamers across genres at every scale of development. The future remains unwritten, and that potential for discovery is what makes gaming such a lasting art form.
