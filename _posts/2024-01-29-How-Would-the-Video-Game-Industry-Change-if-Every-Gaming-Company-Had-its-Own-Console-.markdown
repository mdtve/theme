### Increased Competition and Innovation
With every major gaming company launching their own proprietary console, competition in the industry would heat up significantly. Each company would seek to attract consumers by offering exclusive games that can only be played on their platform. Additional features and services would also vary between consoles in an effort to differentiate their product in the marketplace. This kind of direct competition could spur greater innovation as companies try to outdo each other with new technologies, designs, and gameplay experiences. However, it also risks confusing consumers who are faced with many different console options that are not compatible with each other.

### Rising Costs Place Burden on Gamers   
For dedicated gamers who want access to all major releases, the cost of fully participating in this fragmented industry would skyrocket. To play games from every publisher, consumers would need to purchase multiple proprietary consoles, accessories, and online memberships. This financial burden could price out some segments of the existing gaming population, especially budget-conscious customers or parents buying for children. Maintaining several systems would also take up more physical space in homes. Overall, the rising costs threaten to introduce new barriers for many current and potential gamers.

### Performance and Compatibility Variances
With each company developing their own custom console hardware and software standards, significant differences in specifications and capabilities would emerge between platforms. Game performance, visuals, features, and controls could vary noticeably depending on which system a title was designed for. Ensuring compatibility across the various ecosystems would present major challenges for developers too. System updates or new console generations from each publisher would further fragment uniform technical standards over time. These technical divergences risk negatively impacting the gaming experience for some users.

### Diminished Collaboration Opportunities 
Publishers may prioritize their own console's success over cooperation with rivals in this fragmented landscape. Cross-platform play, content sharing, and cooperative development efforts could decline as companies strive to lock players into their proprietary ecosystems. While competition often drives innovation, the loss of collaborative spirit in an industry currently accustomed to partnerships may limit opportunities for developers and multi-platform releases that benefit consumers. Players invested across several consoles may find it harder to access consistent online communities too. 

### Split and Isolated Gaming Communities
A proliferation of divergent platforms would steadily split the existing gaming community among them. Individual console networks, online services, and game lobbies would cater to separate, fragmented sub-groups of the overall audience. Developers face smaller potential market sizes for each title since audiences are divided. Players risk losing touch with friends on different systems as well. Overall, this fragmentation threatens the cohesion gaming currently enjoys as a collective online space and social experience.

### Building Locked-Down Digital Fortresses     
To lock customers into their ecosystems long-term, expect each console maker to tightly regulate digital sales, ownership, and interoperability. Walled gardens for online stores, friend lists, Achievements/Trophies, and subscription services would strive to make platform switching inconvenient. Heavy-handed DRM, account restrictions, and exclusive payment systems could lock down access to purchased content. Overall, closed and regulated digital experiences risk disempowering gamers rather than respecting them as consumers with ownership of the media they buy.

### Rising Costs and Risks for Developers       
Game creation would become vastly more complex and expensive for developers. Teams must optimize for new hardware with each proprietary console, contend with different technical specification minimums, and maintain multiple codebases. Additional QA, localization, and porting expenses multiply with each additional platform. Significant marketing costs come into play on smaller potential customer bases too. While catering to dedicated fanbases, risks concentrate for developers dependent on the success or failure of individual consoles. Smaller studios may struggle to release games across several systems.

### Risk of Market Instability and Consolidation  
Too much short-term competition could foster an unstable environment if consumer uptake cannot support dozens of consoles long-term. Failed systems or lackluster sales may lead to industry consolidation again over the years through mergers and acquisitions. While variety appeals, consolidating onto several shared standards benefits all parties through economies of scale and sustainable viability. Duplicating costs across too many propriety initiatives invites excessive risk for businesses and consumers. Cooperation seems a healthier long-term strategy.

### Assessing Realism and Sustainability   
Realistically, could enough divergent consoles survive over multiple generations to truly disrupt the market? Console development costs reach into the hundreds of millions, yet each new entrant splits the existing audience further and competes directly. History suggests the sector naturally converges onto fewer major standards and platforms that optimize investment returns through network effects and installed user bases. This scenario of "every publisher with its own box" may seem plausible short-term but faces challenges persisting over the longer-term without sustainable scale or cooperation between companies. Maintaining standards benefits all industries, and gaming appears no exception.

### Conclusion 
While increased competition can foster desirable advances, the downsides of total industry fragmentation seem unlikely to sustain positive results over the long haul. Higher costs, fractured communities, technical challenges and market instability deter lasting prosperity when multiplied across too many narrowly focused initiatives. Cooperation has served the current gaming industry well by empowering innovation within a shared framework respecting both businesses and player interests alike. When weighing realities of console development, some level of partnership and standards coordination ensures viability for all stakeholders in this innovative entertainment medium.
