### A Troubled Childhood
Growing up was never easy. My father struggled with alcoholism for as long as I can remember, which put a strain on our family financially and emotionally. Money was tight and home sometimes felt unstable. Through it all though, my mother and siblings banded together to support each other. As a teenager, I turned to partying as an escape from my unhappiness at home. Though things were difficult, my family's love and support got me through.

### First Encounters with Faith  
As a young child, I vividly remember going to an evangelical holiday program where I gave my life to Jesus. Around that same time, I started attending Baptist church with my mother each Sunday. However, as I got older, other interests pulled me away from regularly going to services. In those difficult teenage years though, prayer became a source of comfort I could always turn to. 

### Exploring Religions and Philosophies
Growing up, I was briefly exposed to Islam through some family friends but it never resonated with me. After high school I became interested in eastern philosophies and was drawn to Taoism and its principles of living in harmony. The concept of balance and flow appealed to me. I also entertained ideas about life after death and our purpose in the universe.

### Doubts with Organized Religion
However, as I observed professing Christians around me, I struggled with their lack of consistency. It troubled me that so many didn't live by the Ten Commandments or teach what Jesus preached. The concept of an authoritarian god demanding constant praise and worship also didn't sit right with me. I began having doubts about rigid doctrines and institutions.

### A Turning Point   
After graduating college, I moved out on my own and took a job delivering dry cleaning in the evenings. One night while making a delivery, I met a girl from a Christian bookshop who was kind and caring. She invited me to her Pentecostal church one Sunday which had a fiery preacher. That night, through his powerful sermon coupled with the Holy Spirit's conviction, I gave my life fully to Christ once more.

### Ongoing Spiritual Journey
Even after rededicating my life, I still had many questions that continued my spiritual quest for truth. While growing in my Christian faith, I remained open to different philosophies and religions, finding pieces of wisdom in each. Prayer and scripture reading brought me comfort during this inner journey. I sought the Lord for answers amidst my doubts and uncertainties about life's deeper questions.

### Questions about God and Ethics  
Specifically, I struggled with how God could allow evils like murder, wars and deadly diseases in the world, yet punish unrepentant souls in hell for eternity. The concept of forgiveness without consequence also troubled me. How could justice be served for wrongdoing? These were complex issues I wrestled with for a long time. 

### Finding Meaning in Adversity
Looking back on my difficult childhood, lack of money, family disruptions and teenage rebellion caused me much embarrassment, anguish, and fear at the time. However, as an adult, chronicling my struggles has helped me understand God's greater purposes even in suffering. While painful, those hardships shaped who I am today.

### Continuing the Quest
My spiritual journey is far from over. I aim to keep an open and questioning spirit on all matters relating to faith, religions, and life's deepest puzzles. While still seeking answers, I take comfort knowing that one day all will be made clear. With God's guidance, I hope to find lasting peace, purpose and clarity through continued searching of scripture, prayer and open dialogue with faithful believers. My quest to understand continues.
