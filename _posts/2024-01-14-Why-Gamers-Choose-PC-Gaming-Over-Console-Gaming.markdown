### Superior Performance and Graphics  
PCs can run games at higher resolutions and framerates than consoles due to their more powerful hardware. GPUs and CPUs in gaming PCs can be upgraded over time to maintain a performance lead. This results in better visual fidelity than current-gen consoles, from finer texture details to higher quality shadows and lighting effects. Dedicated graphics cards allow PC games to reach quad HD, ultra wide, and virtual reality resolutions that console games cannot match.

### Unrivaled Game Library and Backwards Compatibility
The PC gaming platform has accumulated the largest collection of games of any platform spanning multiple decades. In addition to all the latest titles, classic games from the 90s and 2000s can still be played on modern systems. Indie titles and niche genres often release first or exclusively on PC. Consoles do not offer this level of backwards compatibility or catalog depth once a new generation is released.

### Total Control and Customization Options  
PC gamers can configure controls and customize graphics, keys, and settings to perfectly match their play style and hardware. Players can choose mouse/keyboard, a single controller, or a fuller HOTAS or racing pedal setup. Mods extend the lifespan of games by overhauling visuals, gameplay, and content. In contrast, consoles provide a standardized experience that cannot be individually tailored.

### Affordable Gaming Through Sales and Bundles
PC game prices are significantly lower from launch with frequent Steam, GOG and Epic mega sales bringing even bigger discounts. Hardware and bundles from sites like Newegg offer strong value. Free-to-play games and cheaper regional pricing make PC gaming more affordable overall. Over the long run PC gamers save money versus console subscriptions and higher individual game costs.

### An Open and Flexible Platform
The PC ecosystem has open development and distribution, giving creators and players more choice in infrastructure. Hardware combinations are unlimited rather than restricted to a manufacturer's specifications. Users fully own their purchases and can mod, back up, or transfer games without restrictions. This level of accessibility, control and customization is not replicable on closed console platforms.

### In Summary
Both PCs and consoles provide benefits for different types of gamers. PCs demand additional technical proficiency for assembly and maintenance. However, they repay enthusiasts with unmatched flexibility to upgrade, modify and play games as they choose. For those seeking the highest performance, most choice and control in their gaming, the PC platform remains unrivaled.
