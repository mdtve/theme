### Intro  

Caring too much about others' opinions can negatively impact one's life and mental health. While a close network of friends and family provide valuable perspective and support, it's important to ultimately determine your own path and beliefs. This post will discuss why you shouldn't live your life solely to gain approval from others, and why staying true to yourself is most important.

### Don't Live to Please Others  

Being a "people pleaser" means neglecting your own needs, boundaries, and authentic self to cater wholly to what you think others want. This type of behavior leads to anxiety, resentment, and other issues as you lose sight of who you are. Gaining more control over your emotions and learning to say "no" allows you to focus inward on your own growth, happiness, and goals rather than living outwardly for constant validation.

### Others Will Have Opinions Regardless   

With over 7 billion people in the world, it's inevitable that some will like you and some won't, regardless of what you do. Even those perceived as universally loved, like celebrities or influencers, have many critics and haters too. Most people in your daily life won't spend much time thinking about you at all. Try not tointernalize every opinion as truth - others will judge no matter what.  

### This Is Your One Life

You only get one trip around the sun, so make the most of your limited time by living according to your values and priorities rather than bending over backwards trying endlessly to please all diverse crowds. No matter what choices you make, there will always be some who support and some who disapprove. Strive to be happy with yourself above all else.

### Consider Close Ones' Valid Opinions

While you shouldn't define yourself by strangers' views, those closest to you who genuinely care about your well-being may offer worthwhile insight or advice at times. However, ultimately only you know yourself best - so thoughtfully consider input from trusted friends and family but make your own independent decisions in the end. 

### Opinions Are Subjective

Every person perceives the world differently based on their unique life experiences and personality. An opinion critical of you likely says more about the other person's perspectives and biases than your actual character or worth. Don't internalize negative reviews as absolute truth - different doesn't mean deficient. Stay secure in your own reality.

### Stay True to Yourself 

Find fulfillment, confidence and mental well-being from within rather than seeking constant validation externally. Cut ties with so-called "friends" who befriend you for superficial reasons like status or appearances rather than genuinely supporting your happiness and growth as a person. Prioritize integrity over gaining superficial approval.

### Conclusion

In closing, remember that true confidence comes from believing in yourself - not what changing tides of public opinion may bring. While thoughtful consideration of loved ones' input can provide perspective, don't hand your self-worth over to critics or make unjustified sacrifices trying vainly to please all. Focus on living authentically according to your own conscience and values. With self-assurance, no foreign opinion can define you unless you allow it. Wish you the best moving forward in staying true to who you are.
