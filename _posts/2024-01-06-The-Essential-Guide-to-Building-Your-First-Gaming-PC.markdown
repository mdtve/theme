### Choosing the Perfect Processor

When it comes to choosing a CPU for your first gaming PC build, you have two main manufacturers to consider - AMD and Intel. AMD's Ryzen series CPUs offer incredible multitasking performance at affordable prices. The Ryzen 5 3600 is an excellent option for mainstream 1080p gaming, while the Ryzen 7 3700X is better suited for those who also want to stream or do creative work. 

Intel's Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs are still very powerful choices as well. For pure gaming on a budget, the Core i5-10400 is tough to beat. However, if you want to future proof your build or do heavy multitasking, the 6 core/12 thread Core i7-10700K provides more overhead. Be sure to purchase an AMD or Intel CPU that is compatible with your chosen motherboard's socket type.

### Selecting the Perfect Graphics Card  

When it comes to discrete GPUs, AMD and NVIDIA are the dominant players. AMD offers great value with their RX 5000 series, like the RX 5500 XT for entry-level 1080p gaming or the RX 5700 XT for smooth 1440p performance. NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 1660 Super is also an affordable 1080p card, while the RTX 2060 provides ray tracing and 1440p gaming for a small premium.

For the ultimate experience, nothing beats NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 series. The RTX 3060 Ti allows flawless 1440p performance, while the RTX 3080 is truly next-gen with 8K and VR capabilities. Be sure to verify your case, power supply, and motherboard have adequate clearance and connectors for your selected graphics card as well.  


### Choosing High-Performance RAM

When choosing RAM for a gaming PC build, both capacity and speed are important factors. It is recommended to install at least 16GB of RAM to ensure your games have enough memory headroom for many open programs and browser tabs. DDR4 is the standard memory type today, with speeds starting at 2666MHz but ideally 3000MHz or higher. 

Faster memory like DDR4-3200MHz or DDR4-3600MHz provides a small but noticeable boost in framerates. Look for RAM with low CAS latency timings as well for even better performance. Overclocking your memory can help squeeze out extra bandwidth too. Just be sure your CPU's memory controller and motherboard's RAM slots can support the speeds.

### Choosing Maximum Storage Performance 

For storage, choosing between hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs) is an important decision. HDDs provide large capacity for less money, but SSDs are exponentially faster. For your operating system and favorite games, an SSD is highly recommended. SATA SSDs deliver decent speeds while M.2. NVMe SSDs are the fastest mainstream interface available.

PCIe Gen4 SSDs like the Corsair MP600 Pro push performance to never before seen levels. But for most gamers a 500GB-1TB SATA or M.2. NVMe SSD provides the perfect balance of speed, capacity and value. Be sure your motherboard has adequate M.2. slots if choosing that form factor. An HDD can supplement an SSD for extra bulk storage of media files and games you play less often.

### Ensuring Ample and Efficient Power Delivery

A quality power supply unit (PSU) with sufficient wattage is crucial. Aim to select a PSU that provides at least 100W more than your estimated power needs to allow for future upgrades. Stick with reputable brands like Corsair, EVGA, and Seasonic that use high-quality components.

Platinum or Gold rated efficiency is recommended to save electricity costs in the long run. The 80 Plus program tests and certifies PSUs, with Platinum offering up to 92% efficiency and Gold offering up to 90%. Modular cable designs from Corsair or Cooler Master help reduce cable clutter too. An overspecced PSU now means you likely won't need to replace it for many component upgrades later.

### Choosing the Perfect Motherboard

When choosing a motherboard, ensure compatibility with your chosen CPU socket type. For Intel, check for LGA1200 or LGA1151 socket support depending on the generation. For AMD, verify AM4 socket compatibility. More premium boards offer additional features like built-in WiFi/Bluetooth, increased USB ports, and faster/more M.2. slots.

Pay attention to rear I/O, ensuring enough USB ports and the latest connectivity standards. Also check there is adequate clearance and PCIe lanes for your intended graphics card(s). For serious overclocking look at high-end Z490 or X570 boards, otherwise a mid-range B450 or B550 provides great value. Get the right motherboard and your new build will be rock solid.

### Keeping Components Cool Under Pressure 

Cooling is essential for components to sustain peak performance over time and avoid thermal throttling. Most cases include at least one included fan but additional fans help drive overall better temperatures. Air cooling with a large tower heatsink and fan is sufficient for stock speeds. 

All-in-one liquid coolers from be quiet!, NZXT, or Corsair provide sleek aesthetics and slightly lower temperatures than air coolers for mild overclocking. For extreme overclocking, custom closed-loop liquid cooling or full custom water cooling is recommended. Also ensure your case airflow is optimized, with front intake and rear/top exhaust. Positive pressure and dust filters help reduce buildup over time as well.

### Choosing the Perfect Monitors 

For gaming, a 1080p 144Hz or higher refresh rate monitor provides incredibly smooth visuals. When paired with a powerful GPU, 1440p 144-165Hz or 4K 60Hz productivitymonitors take full advantage of today's hardware. Consider features like G-Sync/FreeSync support, IPS or VA panel type, size, and response time as well.  

Ultrawide 21:9 monitors immerse you in games like never before. Multi-monitor or ultra-large 49" setups are ultimate for productivity or flight/racing simulators. Be sure to factor in display connectivity options like DisplayPort or HDMI when selecting a monitor that complements your GPU. A quality gaming display truly maximizes the potential of your new custom rig.

### Building Your First Gaming PC on a Budget

Achieving great 1080p gaming performance need not require a huge budget. By judiciously selecting complementary components and balancing brands versus specs, a solid 1080p build can be had for $800-1000 or less. Compromising to 60Hz over 144Hz or opting for a mid-range GPU over high-end allows savings. 

Consider starting with just 8GB of RAM and upgrading later, or reusing a desktop case, PSU or HDD/SSD from old parts. Patience when waiting for sales on CPU/motherboard/GPU combos maximizes value too. Building your own PC provides a fun, educational experience compared to prebuilts and ensures your dollar goes further to power amazing PC gaming for years to come. With some strategic choices, anyone can achieve their dream build on even a modest budget.
