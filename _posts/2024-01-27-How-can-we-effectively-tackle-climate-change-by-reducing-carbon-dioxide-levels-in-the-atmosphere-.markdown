## The scale of carbon emissions from fossil fuels
Coal, oil and natural gas have powered tremendous economic growth over the past century, but their use has come at a huge cost to our climate. Billions of tons of coal are transported across the world by train each year to feed power plants and factories. The estimated annual emissions from burning these fossil fuels for energy and transportation amounts to over 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. The current level of CO2 in the atmosphere is over 400 parts per million (ppm), the highest in at least 800,000 years. To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists say we need to reduce emissions to keep global warming well below 2Â°C, which will require bringing CO2 levels back down below 350 ppm.

### Transporting vast amounts of coal by rail
 Coal is one of the dirtiest fossil fuels and a major contributor to rising CO2 levels. Each year, millions of rail cars transport billions of tons of coal from mines across vast distances to be burned in power plants. All that coal burned releases a huge amount of carbon into the air we breathe.

## Challenges and obstacles of reducing CO2 levels
While the need to curb emissions is clear, achieving large-scale reductions faces significant technical, economic and social barriers. One challenge is how to effectively store the massive amounts of carbon that must be extracted from the air or emissions sources. Alternative energy systems also need to be implemented on a wide scale to power carbon removal and storage. Both will require huge investments, and shifting away from the fossil fuel economy could disrupt many communities and jobs. Public support for bold climate action has grown, but denial and resistance remains strong in some segments.

### High costs of carbon removal  
One study estimated the costs of directly capturing carbon dioxide from the air could be over $1000 per ton. At the scale needed to achieve our climate goals, the total costs would run into the trillions of dollars. Building the necessary infrastructure would take decades and financing on that scale presents major policy and economic challenges.

## Progress in renewable energy but challenges remain
Some renewables like solar and wind power are now cheaper than fossil fuels for new power generation in many regions. Around the world, renewable energy capacity is expanding rapidly each year. However, in key countries political opposition and denialism continue to slow the transition away from coal, oil and gas. Overcoming powerful economic and political interests invested in the status quo will be crucial to accelerate the deployment of clean energy worldwide.

### Rapid growth of solar and wind installations
According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, global renewable energy capacity increased over 25% between 2016-2020. Solar PV additions doubled during that period. In 2020 alone, renewable capacity expanded by over 10% despite challenges from the pandemic. While progress has been significant, continued rapid growth is needed this decade to achieve mid-century climate goals.

## Potential approaches to reducing CO2 levels  
Multiple technological solutions and policy strategies will likely be needed to draw down CO2 levels to safer thresholds. Some key options include electrifying transportation systems, enhancing renewable power, and developing new carbon removal techniques. Combining complementary approaches at large scale could make meaningful reductions possible.

### Transitioning to EVs and clean electricity
Shifting personal vehicles, buses and trucks to electric power fueled by renewable energy could help end emissions from transportation, which accounts for about a quarter of global CO2 emissions. Pairing electric transportation systems with rapid expansions in wind, solar and other zero-carbon electricity sources could together reduce total CO2 emissions substantially in the coming decades.

## Breaking down CO2 not as straightforward as it seems
While technologies exist to convert carbon dioxide into other substances, at present the energy and resource inputs make atmospheric removal approaches impractical on a global scale. Storing massive volumes of extracted carbon also faces significant geological and environmental challenges. Further innovation will be essential to make large-scale negative emissions economically and technically viable. 

### Challenges with carbon removal techniques
Even optimistic analyses find that directly removing CO2 from the air and storing it underground or in durable products would cost over $1000 per ton using current methods. The energy demands of splitting CO2 apart chemically could end up relying on burning more fossil fuels in many scenarios, limiting their climate benefits. Finding suitable geological storage locations at the scale needed will also be extremely difficult.

## Relying on natural methods like afforestation and ocean fertilization
Large-scale tree planting, or afforestation, can sequester carbon in living biomass, but trees eventually die and release their stored carbon back as CO2. Dumping iron filings in the oceans to stimulate plankton growth that absorbs carbon, known as ocean fertilization, also faces scientific uncertainties about the carbon sequestration potential and ecological side effects like dead zones. While natural strategies deserve research support, they cannot replace direct emissions reductions and engineered carbon removal techniques to achieve mid-century climate targets.  

### Uncertainties with ocean fertilization
The idea of enhancing plankton growth in the oceans through iron fertilization has been studied as a potential carbon drawdown strategy. However, research so far finds that much of the absorbed carbon simply sinks below the surface and does not remain sequestered on human timescales. Large-scale proposals also risk unpredictable ecological impacts that could undo any climate benefits. More research is still needed but fertilizing the oceans is not a proven solution at this stage.

## No quick fixes but multiple paths need to be pursued
Given the immense scale of greenhouse gases already emitted and the lags in the climate system, avoiding catastrophic warming will require global emissions to decrease dramatically in the next two decades while innovating carbon removal techniques that can begin drawing down atmospheric CO2 levels thereafter. There are no silver bullet solutions, and countries must pursue a suite of technological, economic and social changes concurrently if we hope to achieve mid-century climate stabilization goals. International cooperation will also be vital to success.  

### Combining policy, tech and lifestyle changes
Even if the world achieves absolute zero emissions starting tomorrow, the climate would still warm considerably due to past emissions. That means keeping global temperature rise to safe levels will require removing carbon already in the air through engineered approaches. While carbon removal technologies are developing, large-scale implementation faces significant economic hurdles that need to be overcome through policy support, public investment in innovation, and market signals that mobilize resources at emergency speed and scale. Lifestyle changes to reduce individual footprints can also help bridge the timeframe until new solutions are ready. 

## Importance of addressing denial and public perception
In parallel with pushing ahead solutions, just as critical is gaining broad public understanding of and support for urgent climate action. Overcoming misinformation campaigns and entrenched skepticism will be a prerequisite for voters and politicians embracing the bold policies and societal transformations required. An open discussion of trade-offs and shared responsibility can help build consensus for the collective sacrifice needed while prioritizing justice and protecting disadvantaged groups. With clear communication of risks and a shared commitment to solutions, democratic societies can rise to the severity of the climate challenge.

### Overcoming misinformation on climate risks
For many years, doubts about the seriousness of human-caused warming were systematically seeded through public relations campaigns and false balanced reporting on climate science. While scientific uncertainty naturally exists at the frontiers of any field, on the core reality of the climate threat there is now overwhelming consensus among researchers. Misinformation continues to be one barrier preventing urgent policy action demanded by the scale of risks. Constructive public discussion of proposed solutions must include addressing denial and doubt that has been so strategically cultivated. 

In conclusion, avoiding the most devastating consequences of climate change will require global net carbon emissions to reach zero within the next two decades while innovating ways to remove carbon already in the atmosphere thereafter. Key options like electrifying transportation, expanding renewable power and developing engineered carbon removal must be aggressively pursued through policy support and funding research at emergency scale. At the same time, reducing industrial emissions alone will not be enough - international cooperation, technological progress and widespread public understanding of and participation in climate solutions will all be needed for humanity and natural systems to successfully navigate this immense challenge.
