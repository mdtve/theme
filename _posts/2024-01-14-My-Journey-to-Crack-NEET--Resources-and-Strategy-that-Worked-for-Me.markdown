### Resources and Strategy from 11th and 12th Standard

While in 11th and 12th standard, I relied on the NCERT textbooks along with some additional reference books for conceptual clarity. The reference books I used were exemplar problems in physics, Dinesh objective chemistry, and biology leaf for biology. Along with this, I practiced a good number of questions from Aakash and Allen mock tests. Solving these questions helped me assess my preparation as well as work on my weak areas.

### Preparation for the Final Attempt

For final preparation in the last 6 months, I focused more on practicing previously asked questions rather than spending too much time on new topics. I practiced from books such as Aakash and Allen's test series to understand the exam pattern and work on time management. This helped me simulate exam conditions and assess my strong and weak areas better. I also timed myself to increase speed and accuracy. Regular self-reviews kept concepts fresh.

### Edits and Additional Resources

Based on my performance in term exams, I identified some topics that needed more focus. I revisited inorganic chemistry chapters using MS Chauhan and organic chemistry using VK Jaiswal. This helped fill gaps. I also referred to Crash Course videos on YouTube for last-minute revisions. Discussing questions with peers helped gain different perspectives for tackling them.

### Physics Resources 

For Physics, I primarily used the NCERT textbooks along with Exemplar problems by Arihant and Objective NCERT Extra Questions. These books not only covered all concepts and topics but also provided a wide variety of practice questions. I also solved previous year papers for better exam preparation. This helped me analyze my strong and weak areas to focus my preparation accordingly. 

### Chemistry Resources

For Chemistry, my main sources were the NCERT textbooks and Dinesh objective chemistry for problems and questions. These thoroughly covered the curriculum and boosted my fundamentals. I also used MS Chauhan periodically for quick revision and doubts clarification especially for inorganic chemistry chapters. Regular practice kept me engaged and concepts fresh in mind. Periodic reviews ensured long term retention.

### Inorganic Chemistry

One of my relatively weaker areas was inorganic chemistry. To strengthen this, I referred to detailed chapter explanations and diagrams in MS Chauhan alongside NCERT. This helped gain in-depth understanding of concepts like chemical bonding, coordination compounds etc. I also solved inorganic chemistry questions and diagrams from Dinesh Objective Chemistry and previous year questions which improved my speed in solving such problems. Making concise notes further reinforced the learning.

### Organic Chemistry

For organic chemistry, I found VK Jaiswal to be very useful for its lucid explanations and problems. It helped me get a strong hold on basic concepts like IUPAC nomenclature, reactions, stereochemistry etc. I also practiced miscellaneous questions from this book as well as Dinesh for all organic chemistry topics. This strengthened both my fundamentals and problem-solving abilities. Regular practice kept me well-versed with the subject.

### Physical Chemistry 

Physical chemistry posed some challenges for me due to its quantitative nature. I focused more on getting a conceptual understanding from NCERT and then solved as many numerical problems as I could from exemplar problems, RK Gupta, Dinesh objective and previous years' questions. This helped me get familiar with different types of problems and develop the required skills to solve them quickly in the exam. Identifying common formulas was also helpful. 

### Biology Resources

For biology, NCERT formed the base. I strengthened it by referring to Biology leaf for additional explanations, diagrams and questions. This resource covered all topics comprehensively and bridged any gaps in my preparation from the textbook. I also practiced questions from Dinesh objective biology and other books. Keeping conceptual clarity through self-study and group discussions ensured a strong command over topics for the exam.
