### Embarrassing Situations Happen to Everyone
Accidents happen to everyone at some point in their life, even in public restrooms. No one should feel ashamed or embarrassed when dealing with an unexpected situation in the bathroom. Public restrooms see a lot of foot traffic over the course of a day and it's not uncommon for accidents or spills to occur from time to time. Instead of worrying over something you can't control, focus on handling it respectfully and getting the facilities cleaned properly.

### Clean Yourself Up 
The first priority is taking care of yourself. If paper towels are available, use them to wipe down the affected area as best you can. Toilet paper can also be helpful for minor clean ups. Don't hesitate to use paper towels, seat covers, or cloths provided in the restroom to contain any mess and get yourself cleaned up. Try to wipe up any liquid spills on the floor or fixtures as well. Your health and hygiene should come before worrying about what others may think.

### Notify Staff Politely
Once you've addressed cleaning yourself up, inform a staff member politely of the accident. Explain the situation respectfully and ask them to provide any cleaning supplies, paper towels, toilet paper if you've used what was available. Most employees understand that these types of incidents can occur unexpectedly. They want to address the cleanup properly for all users. By letting them know right away, it prevents others from potentially coming into contact with anything before it can be sanitized properly.

### Use Provided Cleaning Products
Employees should provide disinfecting spray or wipes to sanitize affected surfaces and fixtures. Don't try to clean up larger spills or wipe down whole bathrooms yourself, leave that to the custodial staff. Thoroughly wipe down toilet seats, handles, and any surfaces you or the accident came in direct contact with. Properly dispose of any soiled materials like undergarments or wrappers in the garbage so staff can dispose of them. Double check you didn't miss any areas before notifying them the cleanup is complete. 

### Apologize for Trouble, Emphasize Hygiene Importance
When speaking with staff, apologize for any trouble or hassle caused by the accident but also emphasize the importance of proper hygiene practices being followed. Offer to provide any details that could help the staff sanitize areas more completely, such as exactly what fixtures or which stall was affected. It's understandable to feel embarrassed in this type of situation, but focusing on the health and cleanliness of the facilities for all users should be the priority during conversations with employees. Thank them for their assistance and understanding as well.

### Consult Doctor for Diarrhea or Issues
For some cases involving diarrhea or intestinal illnesses, simple cleaning may not be adequate on its own. Speaking to a medical professional is important, whether by calling a nurse hotline or making an appointment. Diarrhea can be a symptom of food poisoning or other gastrointestinal infections. The doctor can determine if anti-diarrhea medication, prescription drugs, or other treatment may be needed. Following their advice ensures proper recovery and prevents spread of germs to others.  

### Water Works for Some Cultural Practices
The way public restrooms are equipped and cleaned may not always align with cultural practices in some locations or communities. If toilet paper is the primary resource provided but water is traditionally used where you're from for sanitary or religious reasons, carefully washing the affected area is perfectly acceptable in an accident situation. Use water from sinks or available containers if paper products alone cannot sufficiently clean up a spill or mess. Respecting various cultural norms is important, especially in public spaces.

### Stores Plan for Increased Demand
When word spreads of accidents occurring or during times of outbreaks like coronavirus, stores may see increased demand for paper supplies, disinfectants and other restroom items. While it's understandable to want to prepare for potential needs at home, panic buying and hoarding essential items can cause shortages and leave others without access. Retailers are able to restock core selections and typically increases amounts on hand during heightened demand periods. Having some basics on hand is fine but avoid panic decisions that could negatively impact community access. 

### Diarrhea Not Main COVID Symptom
With the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, many are understandably more concerned over health matters like diarrhea in public places. However, it's important to remember that diarrhea itself is not generally a main symptom associated with COVID-19 infection. Most suffer mild to moderate effects similar to a cold. Severe gastrointestinal distress requiring hospital care is rare with this particular disease. While outbreaks cause adaptations like increased sanitation, following basic hygiene procedures are what matters most in a bathroom accident situation or when out in public. Maintaining proper practices helps prevent spread of germs regardless of any viruses currently circulating.   

### Concluding Thoughts
Accidents or unexpected situations will inevitably occur regardless of how careful people aim to be. By focusing on handling it respectfully and properly notifying staff, all public restroom users benefit from the cleaning being conducted thoroughly. Most employees understand such incidents happen and want facilities sanitized for health purposes. Remember not to feel ashamed over something unplanned that you have no control over. Taking care of yourself and surrounding areas, then emphasizing hygiene measures being followed is the best approach to bathroom accidents anywhere.
